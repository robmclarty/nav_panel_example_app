# Nav Panel Example App

This is a simple example app (including has_secure_password auth) to demonstrate
some of the usage of the `nav_panel` gem.

NOTE: This app doesn't include any tests. This is just to show some example
usage of the gem inside a working app.

## Installation

Download the app, setup the database, seed the database with the supplied seeds, and
spin'er up to see the `nav_panel` gem in action.
